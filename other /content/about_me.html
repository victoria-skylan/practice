	<h3 id="edu">EDUCATION</h3>
	<p class="box1"> I love School. At least I heve to tell myself that because<span class="bold box1"> that is what I am doing 98% of the time I am awake.</span>I For me, school is an oprotunity to challenge yourself, develop emotionally as well as intelligently, a place to learn new perspectives about the world.
	</p>
	<h3>ART</h3>
	<p class="box1 box2"> I love art. I enjoy photography and videography. My favorite thing to take pictures of is the stars. it is such a surreal experience to let to the shutter be exposed to the world for a long period of time in order to capture the beauty that the human eye can't see. <span class="bold box1 box2">I also love taking pictures of people river rafting.</span>I I am able to capture this moment of thier life when they have such heightened emotions. I also enjoy painting and drawing. I love taking time to create beautiful things.

	<h3 id="rafting">RAFTING</h3>
	<p class="box1 box2 box3"> I love river rafting. I learned this love when I was little. My family went on a week long rafting trip on the Salmon river. I new at that point that I wanted to be a river guide when I grew up. This past summer I had the opprotunity to become a river guide and a photographer for the river. <span class="bold box1 box2 box3">I would row the gear boats, guide the paddle boats, and raft around in the little duckies.</span>I One of my favorite things to do was swim the rapids after I was done taking pictures of them. It was the quickest way to get from my photo spot to the boat.
